Hyperparameter                                               Typical Value
Input Layer Shape            Same shape as number of features (eg: 3 for # bedrooms, # bathrooms, # car spaces in housing price prediction)
Hidden layer(s)              Problem specific, minimum = 1, maximum = unlimited
Neurons per hidden Layer     Problem specific, generally 10 to 100
Output layer shape           Same shape as desired prediction shape ( eg. 1 for house price)
Hidden activation            Usually ReLU ( rectified linear unit)
Output activation            None, ReLU, logistic/tanh
Loss Function                MSE(mean square error) or MAE(mean absolute error)/Huber(combination of MAE/MSE) if outliers
Optimizer                    SGD(Stochastic gradient descent), Adam
