Working with larger example (multiclass classification):

We have seen a binary classsification example (predictiong is a data point is a part
of red circle or blue circle) but what if you had multiple different classes of things?

For example, say you were a fashion company and you wanted to build a neural network 
to predict whether a piece of clothing was a shoe, a shirt 
or a jacket(3 different options).

When you have more than two classes as an option, this is known as multiclass classification.

The good news is, the things we have learn't so far (with a few tweaks) can be
applied to multiclass classification problems as well.

Let's see it in action.

To start, we will need some data. The good thing for us is TensorFlow has a multiclass
classification dataset known as Fashion MNIST built-in. Meaning we can get started
straight away.

We can import it using the tf.keras.datasets module.
