Wow. From these two plots, we can see how much quicker our model with the normalized
data model_1 improved than the model with the non-normalized data(model).

    Note: The same model with even slightly different data can produce dramatically different
    results. So when you are comparing models, it's important to make sure you are comparing them
    on the same criteria (e.g. same architecture but different data or same data but
    different architecture).
