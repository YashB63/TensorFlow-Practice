Think of it like this:

If I gave you an unlimited amount of straight lines and non straight lines, what kind of patterns could you draw?

That's essentially what neural networks do to find patterns in data.

Now you might be thinking "But I haven't seen a linear function or a non-linear function before..."

Oh but you have.

We have been using them the whole time.

They're what power the layers in the models we just built.
