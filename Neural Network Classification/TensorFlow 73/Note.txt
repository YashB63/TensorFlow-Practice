Nice! It looks like our model is almost perfectly (apart from a few examples) 
seperating the two circles.

Question: What's wrong with the predictions we have made? Are we really evaluating our
model correctly here? Hint: What data did the model learn on and what did we predict on?

Before we answer that, it's important to recognize what we have just covered.

Note: The combination of linear(straight lines) and non-linear (non-straight lines)
functions is one of the key fundamentals of neural networks.
