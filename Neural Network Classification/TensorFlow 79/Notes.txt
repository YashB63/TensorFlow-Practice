To figure out the ideal value of learning rate (atleast the ideal value to begin training
our model) , the rule of thumb is to take the learning rate value where the loss is stil
decreasing but not quite flattened out (usually about 10x smaller than the bottom os the
curve).

In this case, our ideal learning rate ends up between 0.01(10^-1) and 0.02.
