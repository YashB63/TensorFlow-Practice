Plot the loss curves:

Looking at the plots, we can see the outputs of our model are very good.

But how did our model go whilst it was learning?

As in, how did the performance change everytime the model had a 
chance to look at the data( once every epoch)? 

To figure this out, we can check the loss curves (also referred to as the learning curves).
