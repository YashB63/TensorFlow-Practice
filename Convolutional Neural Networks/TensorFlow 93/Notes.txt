USING THE SAME MODEL AS BEFORE:

To examplify how neural networks can be adapted to manmyy different problems, let's see how a 
binary classification model we have previously built might work with our data.

We can use all of the same parameters in our previous model except for changing two things:

    - The data : we are now working with images istead of dots.
    - The input shape: We have to tell our neural network the shape of the images we are working with.
        - A common practice is to reshape images all to one size. In our case, we will resize the images to (224,224,3),
        meaning a height and width of 224 pixels and a depth of 3 for the red, green, blue colour channels.
